Thus, an approach which\\nprovides these tools in a way that scales to these datasets is not just\\ndesirable, it is vital. The expertise required spans not just astronomy, but\\nalso computer science, statistics, and informatics. As a computer scientist and\\nexpert in machine learning, Alex's contribution of expertise and a large number\\nof fast algorithms designed to scale to large datasets, is extremely welcome.\\nWe focus in this discussion on the questions raised by the practical\\napplication of these algorithms to real astronomical datasets. That is, what is\\nneeded to maximally leverage their potential to improve the science return?\\nThis is not a trivial task. While computing and statistical expertise are\\nrequired, so is astronomical expertise. Precedent has shown that, to-date, the\\ncollaborations most productive in producing astronomical science results (e.g,\\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey), have either involved astronomers expert in\\ncomputer science and/or statistics, or astronomers involved in close, long-term\\ncollaborations with experts in those fields. This does not mean that the\\nastronomers are giving the most important input, but simply that their input is\\ncrucial in guiding the effort in the most fruitful directions, and coping with\\nthe issues raised by real data. Thus, the tools must be useable and\\nunderstandable by those whose primary expertise is not computing or statistics,\\neven though they may have quite extensive knowledge of those fields.\\n\", 'title': 'Discussion on \"Techniques for Massive-Data Machine Learning in\\n  Astronomy\" by A.

Model is based on two of the main concepts in quantum\\nphysics - a density matrix and the Born rule. As an example, we will show that\\nproposed probabilistic interpretation is suitable for modeling of on-line\\nlearning algorithms for PSA, which are preferably realized by a parallel\\nhardware based on very simple computational units. Proposed concept (model) can\\nbe used in the context of improving algorithm convergence speed, learning\\nfactor choice, or input signal scale robustness.
